    "Ans: \n",
    "1.\tAn Excel not only stores data but can also do operations on the data. A CSV file is just a text file, it stores data but does not contain formatting, formulas, macros, etc. It is also known as flat files. \n",
    "2.\tIn data-warehouse, Excel is preferable for detailed standardized schema specification. \n",
    "3.\tApart from text, data can also be stored in form of charts and graphs.\n",
    "4.\tExcel can connect to external data sources to fetch data. You can use custom add-in in Excel to increase its functionality. Excel allows for Review of Data with detailed tracking and commenting feature.\n"
